    <h2>Our Story</h2>

    <h3>Current Operations</h3>
    <p>
        We're growing our team and operations rapidly, to ensure we can service as many farmers as possible.
        How does it work?
        Farmers can buy inputs with Apollo in cash or credit.
        If the farmer is purchasing their items on credit, they apply for financing and get an instant credit decision -
        powered by Apollo's machine learning credit models. The farmer then chooses the products they need from Apollo’s
        digital store, and picks them up at the agrodealer in their nearest village. We partner with +1000 agrodealers
        to ensure maximum proximity to our farmers.
        All farmers receive best-in-class agricultural training. Farmers who purchase on credit receive insurance to
        protect their investment from unexpected circumstances. Apollo provides the financing for best-in-market farm
        inputs.
        Apollo farmers typically produce 2.5x more than the average Kenyan farmer. At Apollo, our goal is to bring
        commercial farming to everyone. That means providing farmers the financing they need so they can buy better
        products, increase their harvest, and turn their subsistence farming into commercial farming.
        We're redefining investment opportunities for farmers.
